I'm a PhD candidate in the department of Statistical Science at Duke University. Originally from Bouremouth in the UK, I obtained my BSc MPhys in Physics at Warwick University in 2012 and my MSc in Statistical Science at Duke University in 2015. My research interests include Bayesian approaches to variable selection, time series and poisson point processes. I have a strong interest in functional programming langauges and big data technologies. This website contains some code snippets that I have
found useful to write down for future reference.
