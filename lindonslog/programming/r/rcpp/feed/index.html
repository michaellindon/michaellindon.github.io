		<description><![CDATA[replications=rep(1,0,1) - this is a misleading part of the whole article, could you please change it to sth. else? 

Also, i didn&#039;t find the parad version faster than x/y - curious whether we are comparing 8cpus vs. 1 cpu?]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I think I get your point! Right now I really don&#039;t have any serious experience with either way. But I will come back to this topic when I do. Of course any introductory articles on your blog on .C/.Call/Rcpp are highly welcome - I guess I am not the only one who would appreciate it!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I recall that their main selling point was that using &quot;.Call()&quot; really obfuscates the code because you have to &quot;protect&quot; and &quot;unprotect&quot; variables all the time because otherwise the R garbage collector may delete variables that you are using. I tried &quot;.Call()&quot; once and Rcpp is certainly a large improvement on this because it takes care of the protection for you. I use &quot;.C()&quot;, however, which involves some copying of the variables to C++ and then you don&#039;t need to worry about the garbage collector. Most people really object to this transfer &quot;overhead&quot;, but if I am porting something from R to C++ then it would necessarily be something very computationally intensive in the first place, in which case the transfer overhead is negligible in comparison. I guess the people who object to the transfer overhead are those who just want to port a small block of code like a nested for loop, in which case the objection is reasonable. This is what I mean by Rcpp is meant for R-users as opposed to C++ users. I started writing a package for R which I wanted to be as fast as possible, which was the reason I started looking in to this. The only interaction I wanted with R was receiving the initial data and sending the final results - so having nothing to do with R in the mean time, so .C() works just fine for me. Plus with .C() you use your regular C++ datatypes and expressions without worrying about converting them with as.something(). .C() just allows me to code C++ without getting in the way with strange SEXP datatypes and other things. I think you will find that most packages coded in C/C++ with just use .C(). That&#039;s my take on it anyway.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I mean in that sense it would be the choice for as I am an R-user who would just consider resorting to C++ for specific purposes. But you also say that you would rather use &quot;.C&quot; than Rcpp. How is that? There is a very interesting SO thread between Hadley, Dirk and Romain and they (Dirk and Romain) make good points in favor of Rcpp. I would like to know more about your take on this. - your command of German is pretty good btw!]]></description>
