		<description><![CDATA[In this case, what is the difference between private and firstprivate? Do they not both start the parallel region with the value of the variable declared outside of the parallel block?
I.E., in your initial example, if you simple declared x private, did not assign i to x, then did a print of x, would you not get 44 throughout the entire parallel region? If so, then what is point of firstprivate?

Alternatively, does the first case just initialize the private instance of x within the parallel regions to 0?]]></description>
