		<description><![CDATA[Thanks, nice writeup.
Here&#039;s the best theoretical discussion of threads and rng streams, with a clear discussion of problems and justification for TRNG&#039;s methodology, FWIW.

		<description><![CDATA[Hey Matteo, it would be nice to have a package for parallel random number generation for sure, but it might be possible to achieve this with the C++11 pseudo random number generators instead of TRNG (I wrote this post before I was aware of C++11 PRNG). A lot of people would be happy to have one C++11 PRNG object per thread and seed them differently (i.e. seed according to thread id), this is what I always used to do, but the purists out there I think would say that seeding according to thread id is simply not enough as it may still be possible to get overlapping streams. Having said that, I think in practice the chances of getting an overlapping stream are rare, so you might be willing to accept that risk. I know enough to be cautious, but I don&#039;t really know enough how best to proceed.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Hi Michael, many thanks for sharing this! I wonder how difficult would it be to build a R package that makes all the distributions in TRNG available at R level, by using Rcpp. I guess that would be quite useful, as I don&#039;t know about any package that provides such functionality.]]></description>
